                <h2>ANDY PIETRZAK</h2>
                <p style="font-size:larger">Hey There I'm Jedrzej Pietrzak but to make it easy on You just call me Andy :). I am 34 years old. I came from Poland to US when i was 13 years old. It was hard in the begining without any english but that changed after a year or so and now i call US my home. My parents won green cards in a lottery and came here to make a quick buck or so they tought. They had a year to bring myself and my sister but that time flew by and they were not sure if they want to stay.Therfore i was raised by my grandma in Poland along with my older sister. My parents were in US working and providing for all of us and had to stay to get citizneship and then they could bring us over on imigrational status since we were stil under 18. I quickly developed found and developed relationships that i have to this day. I also found out that something i was so amazing at in Poland i wasn't made fo here in US which was traditional school. With that being said i never finished HS but went and got my GED 4 or 5 years after my graduation, to make my grandma happy. From when i was 16 to 19 i worked some bs jobs like pushing carts, cleaning, construction or on register somewhere, until i landed an interview for a material handler in a manufactuiring. I fell in love with the industry and the whole shebang that i was flying through positions until i got blocked because of education. I left the company after 7 years and rest is history, just kept working my way up and here we are i got tired of working for liars and greedy people that only care about themselves and making me do theiur dirty work but also i got tired of telling myself tomorrow or next monday so i told myself shut the .... up! you doing this and here i am. I want to learn as much and as fast as i can. I want to be able to work remotly so ican go and visit my grandma for few months and then buy an RV anmd travel US and work from anywhere i want. To be continued...       </p>
